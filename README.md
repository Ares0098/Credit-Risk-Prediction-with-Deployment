# Credit-Risk-Prediction-with-Deployment
Project Detail :
- Business Understanding : This project aims to build a model that can predict credit risk using a dataset
- provided by the company consisting of data on loans received and rejected.
- Data Requirement : Contains all the information about all the variables in the data
- Data Collection: Properties on the data are available in this section, such as data size, number of data variables, and a quick preview of the data
- Data Understanding : In this section, all in-depth data analysis is performed, such as data distribution, data cleaning, outlier handling, missing value handling, etc.
- Modeling : Clean data will be prepared for input into the models to be compared, the best model will be used for real-time testing and deployment
- Model Inference : The model is tested in real-time
- Deployment : Deployment website using Heroku, Link Deployment : https://credit-risk-prediction-deploy.herokuapp.com/
